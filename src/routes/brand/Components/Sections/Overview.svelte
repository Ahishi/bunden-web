            These resources were created for the needs of Bunden to replace our old logo with
            something that represents us more and a one we own.
            Resources include a logo used wide spaces or full Bunden representation and an icon used
            for square spaces and small form factors. Use of these resources don't require
            permissions to use,
            download or modify for purposes of representing Bunden in any way.
            <br> <br>
            Bunden logos and icons are derived from the font "Archivo" by Omnibus-Type and they are
            constructed of six parts representing the six original members of the Bunden Group as
            well as six letters of the word Bunden. This allows animation merging or splitting of
            the logo into an icon or vise versa.
            The primary color scheme of six pastel colors of the simplified rainbow (the same
            simplifications as the pride flag) represent inclusivity, variety and LGBTQ+
            representation in Bunden.
